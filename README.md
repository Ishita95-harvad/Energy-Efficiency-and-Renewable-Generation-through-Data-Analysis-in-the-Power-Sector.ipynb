## 🔍 Dataset Description
The dataset includes various energy-related parameters:
- **Energy Consumption** – Historical usage patterns across regions.
- **Renewable Generation** – Solar, wind, hydroelectric power statistics.
- **Grid Load Demand** – Power demand at different times.
- **Weather Conditions** – Impact of temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.
- **Efficiency Metrics** – Power loss, storage optimization, and system reliability.

## ⚙️ Analytical & ML Workflow
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize trends using **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib**.  
3️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Transform variables, encode categorical data.  
4️⃣ **Model Selection & Training** – Compare models such as **Time Series Forecasting, Random Forest, XGBoost**.  
5️⃣ **Optimization Strategies** – Improve efficiency using **Reinforcement Learning & Predictive Modeling**.  
6️⃣ **Evaluation & Deployment** – Assess impact with metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.
